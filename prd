Product Name
ScrumPilot — Your AI Scrum Assistant for GitLab
⸻
1. Objective
During daily stand-ups or sprint review meetings, a lot of time is spent updating JIRA/GitLab boards manually after verbal discussions. ScrumPilot automates this by:
	•	Listening to team conversations during Scrum calls.
	•	Understanding who’s working on which issue.
	•	Updating issue statuses and adding comments automatically on GitLab.
This saves time, increases accuracy, and ensures the issue board always reflects reality.
⸻
2. Problem Statement
Teams often:
	•	Forget to update issue statuses after daily calls.
	•	Spend unnecessary time on manual board management.
	•	Lose track of recent updates discussed verbally.
	•	Lack automated, structured logs of progress mentioned in meetings.
⸻
3. Solution Overview
ScrumPilot will:
	•	Join the daily meeting (Google Meet, Zoom, or Microsoft Teams).
	•	Use speech-to-text + speaker diarization to identify who said what.
	•	Parse the spoken update (e.g., “I’ve completed the backend API for ticket #123”) using NLP.
	•	Automatically:
	•	Change the ticket status on GitLab (e.g., from “In Progress” → “Done”).
	•	Add a summary comment under that issue (“Update from Aman: Completed backend API.”)
	•	Optionally, tag the user who gave the update.
⸻
4. Target Users
	•	Agile development teams using GitLab issue boards.
	•	Scrum Masters and Product Managers.
	•	Remote/distributed teams who rely on daily sync meetings.

6. Key Features (MVP Scope)
A. Meeting Listener (AI Agent)
	•	Joins meetings via API (Zoom SDK or Google Meet transcript feed).
	•	Records or transcribes live audio.
	•	Performs speaker diarization (who said what).
	•	Extracts sentences mentioning tickets (e.g., “I finished issue 231” or “I’m working on 198”).
B. Update Parser (NLP Engine)
	•	Uses keyword & pattern recognition to detect:
	•	Issue IDs (#231, “issue 231”, “ticket 231”).
	•	Action verbs like completed, working on, fixed, blocked, testing.
	•	Maps each recognized action to a GitLab status transition or comment.
C. GitLab Integrator
	•	Authenticates via GitLab OAuth or PAT (Personal Access Token).
	•	Fetches issue board for a specific project.
	•	Updates ticket status or adds comments automatically.
D. Scrum Summary Generator
	•	After the meeting ends, generates a structured summary:
